## Project Abstract

The growing occupation of programming has driven the need for online open-source code repositories. Current solutions lack in-depth searching and sharing options. Codebase is a publicly available .NET MVC web application designed for storing code snippets to be shared and discussed online. It implements advanced searching techniques that allow users to find desired code and refutable code faster than current options.

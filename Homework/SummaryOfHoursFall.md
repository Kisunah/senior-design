    - The team met to work on assignment 4 together which was coming up with our user stories and design diagrams. We worked as a team to come up with our list of user stories and each took a design diagram to draw out.
 - 9/27/21
    - The team had a bit of a shorter meeting because we had discussed prior that we would each take our respective areas and come up with the tasks. We each had come up with 5 tasks for the areas that we had decided on in the meeting on 9/13 and it was a meeting to go over them as a team and make any changes we thought were necessary.
 - 10/4/21
    - The team met to develop our timeline and milestone list for assignment 6. We developed our 4 major milestones as a team with a good timeline in mind to make sure we are prepared for the senior expo in March. Then based on those 4 milestones, we took that tasks from the previous week's assignment 5 and fit them into the schedule. We want to have all of our tools finalized around the end of the Fall semester, such as front-end and backend frameworks, languages, and databases. The next step, scheduled for early 2022 was to build out a basic layout for our front-end and have a schema decided on for how the data will be structured in our database. The third major step is scheduled around February 2022, and is focused on full development and implementation of our UI and getting the database integrated into the project architecture and APIs for indexing our data into the database. The last step leading up to the expo is adding our search APIs, unit testing, and documentation writing.

    - The team met to discuss assignment 7, the projects main constraints. Two were fairly straightforward, as time is going to be a factor as we have a strict deadline for completion and economic cost as we plan on not spending any money to develop our application. The two biggest constraints for us  is making sure our app is secure as we will be handling user information and storing login credentials so that is something to focus on, and the other is scope as there are other apps that do something very similar to what we want to accomplish so we need to make sure that we are doing something that sets us apart.
 - 10/18/21
    - The team met this week to create the slides to use in our presentation.

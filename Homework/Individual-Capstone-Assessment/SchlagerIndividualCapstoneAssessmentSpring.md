# Matthew Schlager

For the implementation of this project, I personally developed the user interface for the home and code compiling pages. This includes that HTML and JavaScript required for both pages. In the fall self-assessment, I had discussed my experience with full-stack development, in my experience I am much more comfortable with development of the backend. This area of development has much more rigid standards and requirements, whereas front end work can be very open ended, especially when also designing the interface. This allowed me to build on areas where I am less familiar and comfortable. 

The specific implementation of these two pieces was done through VueJS, Bootstrap, and JDoodle API. VueJS and Bootstrap are two frontend libraries that I am very familiar with and allowed me to build responsive and interactive pages. Specifically for the code compiling page, I employed the JDoodle API to compile code. This was my first time working with the system and I found it very intuitive to use. Overall, the obstacles that I faced were UI design and JDoodle API integration. As mentioned above, I lacked familiarity with UI design, this project has show me I need to put in more work to better understand how to build a visually appealing and functional UI. In terms of JDoodle API integration, I had never personally used a commercial API in a web application. As a result, I had to gain an understanding of CORs as it relates to HTTP requests to outside sources.

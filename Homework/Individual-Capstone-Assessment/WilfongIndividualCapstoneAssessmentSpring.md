My contribution to this project was spread out into various areas. Initially, I formed the team and had plans for us to do a different yet similar project. However, it was collectively decided to shift to a new brainstormed plan that was agreed to be more interesting. Personally, I contributed quite a bit to the planning and design phase of the project. In terms of implementation, my main contribution was to the front-end of the codeblock and user pages. I have taken two web design classes in the past that I believe prepared me well for what our UI required. I’ve also worked with similar front-end heavy applications in my co-op experiences. 

I’ve definitely built upon my development skills as a result of this project. I’ve gotten to learn and use technologies I’ve never used before such as Vue.js and ElasticSearch. I can definitely see myself applying these to future projects as they were quite impressive and useful. On the other hand, it was a bit of an obstacle for me to take on learning these new technologies. I sometimes got stuck trying to get something to work the way I wanted it to because I wasn’t understanding the specific way it was handled with that technology.

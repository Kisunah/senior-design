## Advisor Meetings

This semester the CodeBase development team didn't have any available hours where we could meet in person. This was due to class work and part-time jobs. As a result, communication with our advisor was handled through email and calls.

 - 2/8/22
    - Discussion of overall development plans for the upcoming semester along with the reviewal of work that the team was able to accomplish over winter break. In this conversation we also discussed with Professor Cheng the information we had about the EECS Expo. We also reviewed the deliverables for the [user manual](https://kisunah.github.io/senior-design/).
 - 3/28/22
    - This was for the reviewal of the project deliverables for the upcoming Expo. Professor Cheng reviewed our poster and video. We also discussed the teams plans to attend the expo in person.
 - 4/15/22 
    - This conversation focused on post-expo feelings about how we performed and the judges scores. We also reviewed our plans for the ending schedule and when things would be available for advisor grading.

    - Final project report delivery to Professor Cheng for grading.

## Co-op Experience
I worked all 5 co-op rotations with Siemens Digital Industries Software all mainly focused in back and front-end web development and my first rotation was Spring 2019 and my last was Summer 2021.

o Developed the backend of an application from scratch for the manipulation of PowerPoint slides using TypeScript <br>

__Fall 2019__ <br>
o Refactored TypeScript and C# SDK generators <br>
o Developed a new SDK generator for C++ by populating templated C++ files with data that was parsed from a swagger definition JSON file <br>
o Compiled and tested generated C++ code using CMake <br>
o Tested and debugged generated HTTP routes using Postman <br>

__Summer 2020__ <br>
o Altered service routes to prevent exposure of authentication services and to enhance search results by preventing bots from accessing invalid routes <br>
o Enhanced PDF and JT viewers ability to be able to render files multiple ways <br>
o Added toolbar commands to the JT viewer to enhance part manipulation <br>
o Redesigned the UX of a panel that was used to share projects with team members by adding the ability to select a role for the new member and share to multiple members at once <br>

__Spring 2021__ <br>
o Localized custom web components using the i18n framework <br>

## Project Topic
The focus of this group will be the development of a web based application for the sharing and storing of code snippets. A given user will be able save and classify a piece of code either publicly or privately. Each entry will be able to be tagged by language and purpose, allowing for an easily searchable and filterable nexus of coding solutions. Publicly posted entries will feature a liking and commenting system to promote discussion and the advancement of better code over inefficient code.

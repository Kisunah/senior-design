# Major Project Constraints


## Time
One constraint that this team will face in the development of a web application for code snippet management is time management. The timeline for this project spans two school semesters, but for each developer we are responsible for development and QA while managing fulltime school schedules. It is also worth noting that certain developers work part-time outside of school to support themselves during college. This will require a fair amount of planning and communication between developers. There will be weeks where certain people have lots of time to work while others have next to no time to contribute to the project. This will complicate the timeline as certain features maybe ahead of schedule verses being behind schedule. 

## Security
Security will be another significant constraint for this project. We intend to allow only registered users into the application. Therefore, we will be storing user credentials into the database. For privacy and safety, those credentials should be encrypted. We will also be allowing users to upload code snippets that are private and inaccessible to the public. This means we will need to implement security on those private code snippets to ensure that only authorized users are able to access and view them. These are the specific aspects of security we will be addressing, but there are plenty of other areas of security for us to keep in mind such as keeping the codebase secure, using up-to-date software, limiting user permissions, etc..

## Scope
Scope is something that has come into question as we have been building out the design for the application. While we have a base idea for what we want to accomplish, we have brought up the thought that we might be reinventing the wheel a little bit, so we want to make sure that we are able to implement a feature that sets our app apart from those that already exist and make sure the application is a viable option. So while we have the scope of the main idea, we want to expand on the idea as we develop to make our take unique. 

## Economic Cost
Starting out, our goal will to make the best use of open source software that is available to us to further development. This will be focused on using packages for example from NPM with node.js or NuGet with C#. Down the line, the only thing that we could consider making a small investment into for a short amount of time would be paying for a database service such as Elasticsearch to store our data as well as contain crucial APIs to make the data easily searchable via full text search.

# Major Project Constraints


## Time
One constraint that this team will face in the development of a web application for code snippet management is time management. The timeline for this project spans two school semesters, but for each developer we are responsible for development and QA while managing fulltime school schedules. It is also worth noting that certain developers work part-time outside of school to support themselves during college. This will require a fair amount of planning and communication between developers. There will be weeks where certain people have lots of time to work while others have next to no time to contribute to the project. This will complicate the timeline as certain features maybe ahead of schedule verses being behind schedule.

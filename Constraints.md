# Major Project Constraints


## Time
One constraint that this team will face in the development of a web application for code snippet management is time management. The timeline for this project spans two school semesters, but for each developer we are responsible for development and QA while managing fulltime school schedules. It is also worth noting that certain developers work part-time outside of school to support themselves during college. This will require a fair amount of planning and communication between developers. There will be weeks where certain people have lots of time to work while others have next to no time to contribute to the project. This will complicate the timeline as certain features maybe ahead of schedule verses being behind schedule. 

## Security
Security will be another significant constraint for this project. We intend to allow only registered users into the application. Therefore, we will be storing user credentials into the database. For privacy and safety, those credentials should be encrypted. We will also be allowing users to upload code snippets that are private and inaccessible to the public. This means we will need to implement security on those private code snippets to ensure that only authorized users are able to access and view them. These are the specific aspects of security we will be addressing, but there are plenty of other areas of security for us to keep in mind such as keeping the codebase secure, using up-to-date software, limiting user permissions, etc..

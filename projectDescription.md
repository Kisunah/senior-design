## Project Topic
A web based classification and experiences reporting system for senior design teams to report their experiences with hardware components. Each user will be able to comment on each component's usability, support, documentation, functionality, programming, etc. This system will be able to help future students by aiding them in their hardware selection for their senior projects.
